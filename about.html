    <img src="images/about1.jpg" alt="Evgenia Sakharova">
    <p>Evgenia Sakharova (b. 1990, USSR) — artist, designer, and art director based in Mývatn, North Iceland. 
Her artistic practice explores the interconnection of nature, personal memory, and emotional sensitivity. 
In Evgenia’s works, plants and natural materials become carriers of history and metaphors of human experience. 
She combines different media — from graphics and watercolor to installations and objects — creating spaces 
for reflection on transience and resilience, on time and transformation. Sakharova’s works can be seen as 
an attempt to preserve the fragile traces of both the inner and outer worlds — reminders that nature and humans 
are bound together in a shared rhythm. Contacts: blomlist@gmail.com</p>
